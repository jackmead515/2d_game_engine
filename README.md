Just a simple 2D game engine that I'm working on.

Maybe it will be a weekend project, but who knows!

- [ ] Handle importing images in folders
- [x] Use double[] instead of Float objects
- [ ] Make Utilites for geometric contains(), intersects(), getLineSegments(), getPoints(), etc.
- [ ] Collision Detection using Quadtrees
